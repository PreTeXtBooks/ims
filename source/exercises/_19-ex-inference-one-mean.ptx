    <title>Length of gestation, confidence interval</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Every year, the United States Department of Health and Human Services releases to the public a large dataset containing information on births recorded in the country. This dataset has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. In this exercise we work with a random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released in 2014. The length of pregnancy, measured in weeks, is commonly referred to as gestation. The histograms below show the distribution of lengths of gestation from the random sample of 1,000 births (on the left) and the distribution of bootstrapped means of gestation from 1,500 different bootstrap samples (on the right).</p>

    <title>Length of gestation, hypothesis test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In this exercise we work with a random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in 2014. Provided below are sample statistics for gestation (length of pregnancy, measured in weeks) of births in this sample.</p>
      <p><ol marker="a.">
        <li><p>What is the point estimate for the average length of pregnancy for all women? What about the median?</p></li>
        <li><p>You might have heard that human gestation is typically 40 weeks. Using the data, perform a complete hypothesis test, using mathematical models, to assess the 40 week claim. State the null and alternative hypotheses, find the T score, find the p-value, and provide a conclusion in context of the data.</p></li>
        <li><p>A quick internet search validates the claim of <q>40 weeks gestation</q> for humans. A friend of yours claims that there are different ways to measure gestation (starting at first day of last period, ovulation, or conception) which will result in estimates that are a week or two different. Another friend mentions that recent increases in cesarean births is likely to have decreased length of gestation. Do the data provide a mechanism to distinguish between your two friends' claims?</p></li>

You are wondering if the average amount of cereal in a 10oz cereal box is greater than 10oz. You collect 50 boxes of cereal, weigh them carefully, find a T score, and a p-value of 0.23.</p>

        <li><p>Because the p-value is 0.23, the average weight of all cereal boxes is 10 oz.</p></li>
        <li><p>Because the p-value is small, the population average must be just barely above 10 oz.</p></li>
